# collection-stories
Like galleries, but with stories

This site is currently a proof-of-concept; it takes the structure of the Postcard Gallery site and uses it for more modular content.  Right now, it is just a Halloween site, but eventually the home page will be a collection of cards, similar to Postcard Gallery, which will each link to something like this Halloween collection.

However, the long term goal is to provide more narrative content; images and text that flow together, addressing entire topics, rather than consisting exclusively of links out to other content.  For now, this content is being posted on Tumblr while we address other issues and projects.
